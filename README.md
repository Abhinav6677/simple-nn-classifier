# Iris Flower Classifier (2-Layer Neural Network in PyTorch)

## Overview

This project implements a basic multi-class classification model using a two-layer neural network built from scratch in PyTorch. It trains on the Iris dataset and tracks accuracy over 50 epochs.

## Files
- `data_loader.py`: Loads, splits, and normalizes the Iris dataset.
- `data_model.py`: Defines a simple 2-layer neural network.
- `data_training.py`: Trains the model and plots train/test accuracy.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch matplotlib scikit-learn
2. run this command on any CLI
   ```bash
   python train.py
